    "# Q1. Explain Class and Object with respect to Object-Oriented Programming. Give a suitable example.\n",
    "In object-oriented programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint for creating objects (a particular data structure), providing initial values for state (member variables or attributes), and implementations of behavior (member functions or methods). An object is an instance of a class, which is created at runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider a class named Person, which could have attributes such as name, age, and gender. The class could also have methods such as introduce and greet, which allow the object to perform actions. When an object of the Person class is created, it is given unique values for the attributes and can use the methods to perform actions."

    "The four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",

    "1.Encapsulation: This refers to the wrapping up of data and functions into a single unit or object. It provides a secure mechanism for protecting data from outside access or modification.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Inheritance: This allows a new class to be derived from an existing class. The new class inherits all the properties and behaviors of the existing class and can also add new properties and behaviors of its own.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Abstraction: This is the process of hiding complex implementation details and providing only necessary information to the outside world. It helps to reduce the complexity of the system and increase the ease of use.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Polymorphism: This allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a single class. It enables the implementation of common operations in a single method, which can be applied to objects of multiple classes."
